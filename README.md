# NN-Classify
NN-Classify - Insurance Availability Prediction Neural Network
The Insurance Availability project is aimed at developing a deep learning neural network that can predict if a person has insurance based on multiple factors, like age and affordability. By analyzing these features, the model can provide insights into the classification problem.

### Features
Predicts Insurance availability using a deep learning neural network.
Utilizes features like age and affordability.

### Dependencies
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Tensorflow (Keras)

> I used this to project to master binary classification using Neural Networks. Heres what i learned:

The activation function for the output layer in binary classification problems is 'sigmoid' because the sigmoid function outputs values in the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as the probability of the input data belonging to one of the two classes.
Input Shape = Number of features considered for prediction. In this case, 2 (age and affordability).
